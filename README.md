Bioinformatics Laboratory Work – Google Colab Workflows

This repository contains a collection of Python-based bioinformatics workflows developed and executed using Google Colab. Each notebook demonstrates the implementation of key computational biology techniques used in molecular biology, genomics, and sequence analysis.

Contents of the Repository
1. Retrieval of Biological Data

Workflow for retrieving sequence, structure, and NGS data.

Data sources include GenBank, PDB, Zenodo, SRA, and ENA.

2. Retrieval of Medical Imaging Records

Workflow demonstrating the retrieval of biological and medical imaging datasets from remote repositories.

3. Metagenomic Analysis

Basic workflow for processing environmental and microbiome datasets.

Includes steps for sequence handling and preliminary analysis.

4. Primer Designing

Step-by-step workflow for designing PCR primers using Python-based tools.

Includes primer construction, validation, and parameter considerations.

5. Sequence Alignment

Workflow covering pairwise and multiple sequence alignment.

Demonstrates scoring matrices, alignment algorithms, and result interpretation.

6. Restriction Mapping

Workflow for identifying restriction enzyme cleavage sites.

Generates digital restriction maps for given DNA sequences.
