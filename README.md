Bioinformatics Laboratory Work – Google Colab Workflows

This repository contains a series of Python-based bioinformatics workflows developed and executed using Google Colab. Each notebook documents the implementation of essential computational biology techniques commonly used in molecular biology, genomics, and sequence analysis.

Contents of the Repository

The repository includes the following Google Colab notebooks:

1. Retrieval of Biological Data

Workflow for retrieving sequence, structure, and NGS data.

Data sources include GenBank, PDB, Zenodo, SRA, and ENA.

2. Retrieval of Medical Imaging Records

Workflow demonstrating retrieval of biological and medical imaging datasets from remote repositories.

3. Metagenomic Analysis

Basic workflow for processing environmental and microbiome-related datasets using Python-based tools.

4. Primer Designing

Step-by-step workflow for designing primers using Python libraries.

Includes sequence input, primer construction, and validation steps.

5. Sequence Alignment

Workflow covering pairwise or multiple sequence alignment.

Demonstrates alignment algorithms, scoring methods, and result interpretation.

6. Restriction Mapping

Workflow for identifying restriction enzyme cleavage sites in DNA sequences.

Generation of digital restriction maps.

Tools and Technologies Used

Google Colab

Python 3

BioPython

NCBI Databases and APIs

Sequence Analysis Libraries and Utilities

How to Use This Repository

Open any .ipynb notebook from the repository.

Optionally select “Open in Colab” (if available) to execute the notebook interactively.

Run the cells in sequence within Google Colab.

Modify data inputs or parameters as required for experimentation or analysis.

Purpose of This Repository

This repository is intended to serve as:

A structured record of bioinformatics laboratory exercises.
