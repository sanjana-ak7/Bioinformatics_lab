# Bioinformatics Laboratory Work – Google Colab Workflows

This repository contains a collection of **Python-based bioinformatics workflows** developed and executed using **Google Colab**. Each notebook demonstrates the implementation of essential computational biology techniques used in molecular biology, genomics, and sequence analysis.


## Contents of the Repository

### 1. **Retrieval of Biological Data**
- Workflow for retrieving **sequence, structure, and NGS data**.
- Data sources include **GenBank, PDB, Zenodo, SRA, and ENA**.

### 2. **Retrieval of Medical Imaging Records**
- Workflow demonstrating retrieval of **biological and medical imaging datasets** from remote repositories.

### 3. **Metagenomic Analysis**
- Basic workflow for processing **environmental and microbiome datasets**.
- Includes sequence handling and preliminary analysis steps.

### 4. **Primer Designing**
- Step-by-step workflow for designing **PCR primers** using Python-based tools.
- Includes parameter selection, primer construction, and validation.

### 5. **Sequence Alignment**
- Workflow covering **pairwise and multiple sequence alignment**.
- Demonstrates alignment algorithms, scoring matrices, and interpretation of results.

### 6. **Restriction Mapping**
- Workflow for identifying **restriction enzyme cutting sites**.
- Generates digital restriction maps for given DNA sequences.


## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Google Colab**
- **Python 3**
- **BioPython**
